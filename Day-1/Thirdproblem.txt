What are keys in React JS? How keys are involving  in array processing?

In React, keys are special attributes that are used to uniquely identify elements in a collection (such as arrays) rendered by React. 
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed from a list. 

When elements are dynamically generated from an array, React uses keys to efficiently update the UI.

Ex:
const items = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Item 3' }
];

function List() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map(item => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>;
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
